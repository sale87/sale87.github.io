My name is Sasa Ranisavljevic. I live in [Belgrade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade), spending most of my days [coding](http://www.sbgenomics.com/) (almost always with [music](http://www.last.fm/user/pax404) in background).

Sometimes I'm [writing](http://puts.rand.rs/). Sometimes I'm [retweeting](https://twitter.com/sale87). I'm trying to [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10031318-sa-a-ranisavljevi) as much as I can.

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/sasa-ranisavljevic/57/17a/979). I also have [Github](https://github.com/sale87) account (although I'm using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sale87) more for private stuff).

I like to play Go, Starcraft and Counter Strike. I play bass guitar.
